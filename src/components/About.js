            Hi, my name is Kelly. I'm a web developer based in London, looking for opportunies in web development.
            A graduate from Queen Mary University of London, with a First Class Honours BSc Mathematics degree.
          </p>

            I've had exposure to the tech world - working in digital at British Gas and helping to build new features on their responsive Beta app. 
            I learnt a lot about writing clean and readable code, collaboration and agile methodologies. 
          </p>

            I've recently completed the Kodiri Coding Bootcamp, refining and enhancing my skills by learning to build full stack, responsive apps from scratch!
            During my time at Kodiri, I have built a solo app (Kodlfix) as well as a Team App (Fridge-App). 
            On top of this, I have attended and provided support for several Kodiri meetup events - 
            most recently I won the Intermediate Challenge at the Silicon Roundabout event held at the Accelerator (part of Metropolitan University)! 
            Navigate to the following sections to find out more about the tech stack used and projects I've worked on.
